# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 


# Tools

## Learn about workflows on the user canvas
user workflows are represented as json files under `user/default/workflows`

## Take a look at some workflow templates and examples
When ask about workflows, take a look at `tools/workflow_templates` for inspirations

## Get information about installed nodes
Run `python tools/call_object_info.py `

## Model Downloader

### Prerequisites:

- Need HF_ACCESS_TOKEN and CIVITAI_API_KEY environment variables set.

To download models, you need to source the file (load it into your current shell) before you can use the functions.
```
source tools/downloader.sh
```

### Download a model from civitai:
```
download_from_civitai url output_path
```

Example: Download juggernaut model
```
download_from_civitai \
    "https://civitai.com/api/download/models/471120?type=Model&format=SafeTensor&size=full&fp=fp16" \
    "./models/checkpoints/Jugg_X_RunDiffusion_Hyper.safetensors"
```

### Download a model from huggingface:
```
download_from_huggingface repo_id filename output_name output_dir
```


Example: Download sdxl 1.0 controlnet from 
https://huggingface.co/Shakker-Labs/FLUX.1-dev-ControlNet-Union-Pro/resolve/main/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors?download=true
```
download_from_huggingface \
        "Shakker-Labs/FLUX.1-dev-ControlNet-Union-Pro" \
        "diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors" \
        "flux_diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors" \
        "./models/controlnet" # output directory
```
